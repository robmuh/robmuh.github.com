<h1>Moving To Jekyll</h1>
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> caught my eye more than a year ago, about the same time <a href="http://github.com/robmuh">GitHub</a> did. I’ll save my rant about how ironic it is that the cool <em>new</em> thing on the Web is static sites and blog engines. Anyone remember how cool guestbooks were back in ‘94? Anyway, it was enough to get me wanting to do an entire static blog engine of my own, (which you might notice on my GitHub). But teaching at the college and a few days of holiday vacation convinced me to just use GitHub pages, which includes Jekyll. It doesn’t mean that someday I might not still write a full node.js equivalent that will import Jekyll sites as elegantly as Jekyll slurps in WordPress and other blog engines. But since I use GitHub daily for my commits for about everything, updating my web site and blog has become such a simple matter it will be very hard not to just continue to use Jekyll. Besides, the formatting and style of the Jekyll site, plus the amazing design sense of it’s creator are spectacular.</p>

<p>To all my new students in 2014, let me say hello and wish you the best while I finish fleshing this thing out. Go ahead. Give it a try as well. I’ll even give you extra credit. <em>grin</em></p>

<p>Now I have to decide if porting all my ancient SourceForge code is worth it, nah.</p>
