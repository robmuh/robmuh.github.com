Ira: What are some of the things that we know that the NSA has broken
into?

Matt: So we have heard a number of things that we can probably credit
for real. &hellip; random number generators &hellip; we know that
NSA through NIST &hellip; has very likely put back doors in some of
those standard algorithms that allow them to essentially break those
systems entirely.

Ira: You mean the NSA created those back doors?

Matt: That's exactly right. So NIST works with NSA --- and they're
required to by law. We thought NSA was helping NIST by developing more
secure standards for Americans to use. We now suspect --- and have
strong evidence to believe --- that the situation was exactly the
opposite; that NIST was being used to put out standards that the NSA
could break.
