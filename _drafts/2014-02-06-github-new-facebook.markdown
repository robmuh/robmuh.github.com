### GitHub has web site hosting and development, Facebook does not

### GitHub focuses on versioned content, Facebook does not


### Will your mom ever get on GitHub?

kids raised to code from early on will use GitHub and Twitter more than
Facebook

### GitHub is built on amazing technology, Facebook is built on PHP


### Facebook has sold out to present advertising, GitHub will not

### Facebook pretends you have private data, then makes it public

### GitHub has strong separation between private and public data

### GitHub has a way to store all your content, Facebook does not

### GitHub has taken a mashup approach, Facebook has not
