subtitle: The Best Place for Pet Developer Cephalopods to Dwell

I'm betting it was no accident that the creators of [Digital Ocean][]
picked the best metaphor to match the [GitHub][] Octo-Mascot. It's
simply the best small to medium hosting a developer could dream of
today.

Digital Ocean is so good --- I mean everything about it --- that just
having an account there makes me want to move to New York --- well,
that and [Hacker School][] and [The Ashtanga Yoga Institute][] and
&hellips; I digress.
