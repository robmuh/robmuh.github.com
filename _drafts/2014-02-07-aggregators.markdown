subtitle: And not just because Google dropped them

Aggregators have always been a bad idea.

They make a copy of the page:

* Assumes no change later
* Requires additional place to store
* Potentially dilutes SEO hits
* Eliminates reading of often useful comments

Doesn't even make sense for video anymore since can subscribe to
YouTube channel.

Audio Podcasts still fundamentally rely on this because their is no
alternative.
