In the 90 is started static, then DB driven was cool, but integrating DB2 or Oracle was insane, then we went lite, SQLite, and then back up to MongoDB.

"MongoDB Doesn't Scale"

- better at concurrency
- aws has improved, priotiy iopts, ssds (used to have to be very expensive, but they have brought it down to the smaller instances for anything that is io intensive), 
- mongo still very young in the database space

"We really built what we wish we had."


Document model

There will be consolidation.

"Days of one database for all my problems are definitely gone."

* Relational Database
* Data Warehouse
* Document Database
* Key-Value Store ("cache-kind of system")

"Bad Ass"

* a lot of data about an entity
* 1-many mappings
* CMS, CRM
* "[loosely structured data] is a great example for us" Eliot Horowitz
* web apps lend themselves well to it
* "any time you are working with APIs, which are probably giving you some JSON back ... you don't actually have control of the model of the data"

Relational
* accounting and finance

"Amazon is moving faster than open source"

"Opensource has become table stakes ... it's the default. You have to proved why you *shouldn't* be open source now ... if you want to be in this game."
"APIs for sure ... huge thing in the future."
