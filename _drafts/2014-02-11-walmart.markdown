Bell Labs, Big Blue and the like may need a reminder that the fastest
gains in innovation come when motivated to meet an immediate, often

computing compliments Walmart's cutting edge adoption and promotion of
[Node.js][] and other technologies that 90% of IBMers, for example, have
never heard of.

### Consumers Drive Innovation

obsessed Walmart shoppers in debt to their eyeballs but still among
the %53 of Walmart Black Friday sales from mobile devices, the truth
that consumers provide the engine (and dollars) promoting innovation
seems more evident now than ever.
