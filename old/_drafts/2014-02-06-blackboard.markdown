title: Blackboard, Just Say No
---

[Blackboard][]'s technology and business models are bad for education ---
especially online [flipped][] classrooms. Just say no to the
institutional addiction.

### No Real Mobile Device Support

Students simply cannot take any material you put into Blackboard with
them. Yes they have a mobile app. No it isn't free. No students don't
bother downloading it. Yes even if they did download it they would
have to go to another external site to watch half the video content
(usually on YouTube).

### Apple Did It. Microsoft Did It.

Apple and Microsoft have been dueling over the education market but
they are operating systems, not learning management systems.

### No One Profits from Addiction

Blackboard is living in the dark ages of business models.

Command and control business models are crumbling all around us.
Apple's operating system is free. Microsoft's OS is free. Gone are the
days of lawsuits and patent valuation.

Blackboard wants you addicted. They want you to never be able to
leave. They want to possess literally all of your information on their
servers.
