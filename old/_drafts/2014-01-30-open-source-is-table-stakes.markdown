CTO of Mongo succinctly describes the current age of connectivity and
innovation as 'table stakes', as in, you can't even play in the game
without it.

"What? You say your server/OS/database software is *not* open source?
Um, ok" as we politely find an reason to talk to someone else.

You simply are not relevant today if you do *not* have an open source
offering, even if you think you are by tricking your stock holders or
other customers into paying you for things like your 'patent
dominance.'
