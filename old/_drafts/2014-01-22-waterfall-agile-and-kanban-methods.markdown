title: Waterfall, Agile, and Kanban
---

Every developer that has ever attempted code has used a *method* whether
they were aware of it or not. Rather than spend a great deal of time
expounding the subject matter of countless doctoral theses or silicon
valley rants about the flavor of the month I'll try to net them out for
you enough to know which one to pick for yourself or simply learn about.

*Old Dude Alert:* I have seen a lot of different development approaches in
the last 25 years working in the smallest of *shops* (like my room) to the
hip Nike.com to the biggest, bluest ivory tower of them all IBM. No I
haven't worked for Google. Does starting (and abandoning) the interview
process count?

Here's the universal truths about development methodologies:

* There will be a new one in 10 years or less
* There will be radical adoption when a new one comes out
* Bozo buzzword managers force early adoption
* Most teams don't actually follow their method right
* There will always be dissenters (we <3 Kirk, Cake, and Jobs)

Like Carlin says, "Question everything."
