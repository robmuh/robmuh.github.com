### Don't include dates, on anything

We simply cannot have the reader able to pin the information in our
posts to any specific date or time. That would let the reader somehow
thing that our post is less valid at a future time. Our opinions and
information a supremely relevant and the reader need not be distracted
by when it was written. Besides, if they must know they can always
look at the source.

### Remember traffic is all important

If you don't have traffic, you don't make money, and seriously, what
other reason is there to blog besides make money? Other bloggers that
do it for free or to share about their lives are fine, but we all know
that only *professional* bloggers actually get paid.

### No one will take you seriously without embedded advertising

### Use a serif font

### Engage the readers interest with frequent style changes

### Style your blog for desktops 

### Use subtle colors and color changes for all hot links

### Never link to anything else since traps the reader increasing your Google ranking

### Don't waste time on spell checking

Getting the content out now is much more important. It's worth the
risk to have one or two misspelled words if it means you beat the
other bloggers out with the current hot topic, thus pushing more
traffic your way.
