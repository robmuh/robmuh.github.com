title: NoFlo and Node.js, Going with the Flow
subtitle: An Ancient Paradigm Based on Organic Life Returns

Ever watch the development of a human fetus? How about an assembly line? A
Chipotle burrito? Or even a snowflake or other ice crystal? What do they
have in common? They are developed as they flow through steps and
interactions which change, adjust, or build the object.

Back at Nike in the 90s I developed a Java library to assist with
shopping on Nike.com by creating a mutable cluster of data, using
simple Java properties objects, and allowing it to be passed along as
if down the assembly line. This flexibility allowed the glob of data
to be morphed as it traveled into whatever the workers along the path
decided it needed during it's flow. 

This model flies in the face of a lot of traditional, strongly-typed
object-oriented paradigms because the data blob has no strong type. 

Dynamic languages are clearly leading when business logic, evolution,
and quick changes are needed for the same reasons.

Recently I read about [NoFlo][] and all the memories came flooding
back. Then it occurred to me.

The NoSQL movement toward document databases is exactly this.

Modern tagging is another example of the crowd acting to shape things
by their observance of the object and data.
