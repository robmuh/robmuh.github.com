"That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse."

There is perhaps no more life-affirming movie in my top ten more
than [Dead Poet Society][], premium art in it's storytelling and
provocative, tragic, plot. Leave it to Apple to connect it to what
makes all the tools and noise valuable. They facilitate poetry.

Have you found what makes work, education, and life worth living?
