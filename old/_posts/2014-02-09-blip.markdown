title: Blip, Thanks but BuBye

I used to think pushing your video content to as many services as possible
with [Blip.tv][] was a good idea. But ultimately centralizing your videos
and subscribers on [YouTube][] and premium content on [Vimeo][] is
better for everyone.

YouTube is about building subscribers and reach.

[Vimeo][] is where you put your premium content you want to lock down.

### YouTube for Obvious Reasons

* YouTube dominates
* YouTube is blazing fast for 1080p upload and delivery
* YouTube is tied to Google Plus
* Pushes to YouTube show up on your Google Plus site
* Pushes are included in Google business page site linked from maps
* YouTube is easiest to embed
* YouTube allows you to have multiple channels with different names

### Why One Service is Best

* Builds a better [tribe][]
* Does not splinter your subscriber base
* Easy comments response and notification
* Makes video corrections and removal possible
* Commenting and annotation are in one place
* One-stop shopping for analytics and advertising

### Vimeo for Premium Content

* If I have movie quality, premium videos
* If I want pay-per-view
* If I want to have paid subscriptions to my videos
* If I want to securely stream video from mobile app

### The good 'ol days

Once upon a time (2007) I had an series of videos on how to make a series
of videos as well the [Hey Avatar][] training series aimed at helping
beginners with [OpenSim][] and [Second Life][] --- particularly for
virtual conferences such as the [IBM Academy of Technology][]. Back then
blip.tv was really the best way then to reach the most people in the
shortest amount of time. Here are reasons I chose it:

* One upload gets pushed to all major video sites
* Analytics
* No need for feedburner and the rest for iTunes, etc.
* Reaches the most people for public content
* Wider net for public content directs more to premium content

Problem is that I never really knew who was watching, who was
commenting, and how to take stuff down. The worst part of all was
building the expectation that I was actually on one of the services
with those watching my videos there and then just not responding at
all to their comments. It made me look like I did see them or didn't
care.

### Don't host your own

In case you were thinking of it. Those days are also gone. Here's a great
[explanation][] of why.
