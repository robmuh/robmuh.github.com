title: Video Killed the Lecture Star
subtitle: Why Video is Flipping More than Classrooms

Finally educators can be as lazy as programmers. Now they can craft
their product into its best form, capture it, and share it with those
that care, (which may or may not be their official students).

[Khan][], [Bowen][] and others really just outed the obvious. With
*everyone* watching videos from the Internet on every topic imaginable
why would education not take advantage of it. 

Why didn't this take off earlier? I betting because the old guard enjoyed
pontificating in front of lecture halls of hundreds of students. And
others were too in love with their PowerPoint creations.

Stop for a moment and thing about how stupid that is. No one can
really ask any questions, even if they can actually hear the
professor. Some even fumble around recording the lectures as if their
lives depended on it. The whole scene is utter foolishness unfit for
higher (or any) education. 

Big the real enemy to learning is something far greater.

### Time Kills Education

Why is it that so many in schools opt to just attend the study hall
labs instead of even attend the lectures? I did this very thing for
four years of Calculus in college attending maybe a half-dozen
lectures in total and aced every course. Those lectures were a waste
of everyone's time, including the professor who's name I don't even
remember, unless, that is, the professor was enjoying the celebrity of
it all, which I think they do at that level.

Next time you are in a lecture hall watch what happens today. Everyone has
a laptop and/or phone and they are only half listening in case the
professor says the magic words, "OK, listen because this will specifically
be on the test." What an asshole. It is cruel and unusual punishment to
force an overwhelmed, overcrowded lecture hall of students to endure that,
unless the professor really is a celebrity, in which case let's just call
it and deal with it like it is, a rock concert with less risk of deafness.

Whatever you call it, lectures of those types, as well as stuffed
high-school classes, are utter wastes of everyone's time.

### Flipped == Time and Attention

If you have more than one student in your class someone isn't getting
the personalized attention they need. I struggle constantly when
dealing with classes of just 15 to make sure something is really
sinking in. It doesn't help that I've spoiled myself @SkilStak with
teams of three-students each. I just have more frequent classes. At
maximum capacity that is 16 students per day in an 8-ish hour day with 90
minutes per intense session (anything less is a waste of everyone's time).
If all my students came just once a week, which honestly is all they need
at that intensity level if the material is derived from a project of their
own creation and interest, that makes
