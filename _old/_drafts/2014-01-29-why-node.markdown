"So you can have a web upload progress bar," says Ryan Dahl [paraphrasing], the creator of the [node.js][] experiment.

This is a dry technical topic, but an exciting one for technologists.

The rise of do-two-things-at-once in the formerly quick
request-response world of the web gave birth to thinking like Ryan's
node.js as well as the wildly popular [nginx][] web server both of
which are *event driven* and *asynchronous*. The age of memory-hogging
intensive, synchronous let's-spawn-dozens-of-child-processes model
such as that found in the original Apache web server has passed.

The cloud has changed everything. I once created several automations for
instantiating Apache virtual servers for Teleport customers. All these
light-weight web sites shared a common system and web server, which was
given a healthy amount of RAM to split between them all. Today these
same customers can flip on an [AWS][] or [Digital Ocean][] cloud
instance and have all the autonomy they could ever want, if they even
need a full machine.

The demand for behemoth software applications is dramatically
declining in favor of granular apps and much smaller systems dedicated
to one function.
