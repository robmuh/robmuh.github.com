subtitle: Why I Still Prefer You Over Amazon
---

Despite a very rocky road I will stay with Rackspace over Amazon or
even Digital Ocean.

Nevermind the fact that all my email goes directly to my Google Spam
folder because forwarding with [mailgun][] somehow taints it all;
Nevermind the fact that I still cannot download a copy of my virtual
image; Nevermind that when you first setup my server it didn't work
for a week because of some 'bad MAC addressing fluke on [your] end.'

### I'm already setup on Rackspace.

### Rackspace is Cheaper for Small and Mid-Size Companies
