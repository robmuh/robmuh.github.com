Ever sat in front of a slide from a corporate training module
and watched the minimum seconds tick down so you can breeze through
to the quiz at the end and get credit? If so you know what
I'm talking about. How does forcing a person to stare at a page
longer increase mastery of that material?

Yet somehow this time accounting is required by some distance learning
educational standard to enable them to defend against litigation when
some bogus student sues them for failing. Apparently this helps
the institution being sued prove the bad student didn't login to the
content LMS and if he or she did spent very little time on the module
staring at it.

The amount of time staring at something has *nothing* to do with learning
and varies so radically between individuals it is never worth measuring
as an indication of progress. How does 'staring time' fall into the
set up acceptable rubrics? (A fancy word I can't help think was
invented by an academician to sound smarter.)

Khan makes this point to great effect in One World Schoolhouse. But
I'll save that rant for later.
