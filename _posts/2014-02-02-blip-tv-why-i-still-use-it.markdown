title: Why I Still Use Blip
---

[Blip.tv][] publishes your videos to [YouTube][], [Vimeo][], [iTunes][],
its own site and more. The only reason not to use it would be to sell
access to premium content videos, in which case [Vimeo seems best][].

Once upon a time (2007) I had an series of videos on how to make a series
of videos as well the [Hey Avatar][] training series aimed at helping
beginners with [OpenSim][] and [Second Life][] --- particularly for virtual
conferences such as the [IBM Academy of Technology][]. Back then blip.tv
was really the best way then to reach the most people in the shortest
amount of time and looks like it still is. Here are my main reasons for
choosing it again:

* One upload gets pushed to all major video sites
* Analytics
* No need for feedburner and the rest for iTunes, etc.
* Reaches the most people for public content
* Wider net for public content directs more to premium content

However, if you have any plans to monetize your content itself Vimeo
looks like the clear leader from where I'm sitting.
