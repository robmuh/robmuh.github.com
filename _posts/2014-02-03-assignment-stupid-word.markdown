title: Assignment, A Stupid Word
subtitle: Use project, activity, challenge, task instead
---

Do teachers still *assign* tasks, homework, and projects? I don't
think so. Modern learning comes from within. It doesn't have to be
assigned, indeed it shouldn't be.

Recently a student of mine was confused by my use of the 'Do:' prefix to
indicate an assignment in [Blackboard][]. (I tend to like verbs instead
of nouns for everything.) The missing 'Assignment:' prefix threw him
because even though the school decided to change the *Assignments* main
menu item to *Course Content*, which I applaud, he had become
conditioned to look for *assigments*.

As my mother-in-law is found of reminding me, this sent me into an
analytical brain-crash.

### Who decided learning activities are 'assignments' anyway?

Yes we have to have some way to identify subject matter and skills
that must be mastered, but the word *assignment* invokes images of
industrial-age teachers who beat their kids with rulers, cameoed in The
Wall.

And if you are in the business world it reminds me of the grey,
lifeless drones *assigned* tasks in Joe V.S. The Volcano:

### Learning does not (and should not) have to be assigned

True learning, the kind that gets high-praise by students from
[SkilStak][], [Hacker School][] and others comes from an internal
desire to learn consistent with Daniel Pink's great explanation of
drive, which I believe is part of an emerging new culture of
intelligence and learning championed by Pink, Robinson and
others:

Learning activity? Yes.

Challenge? Yes.

Project? Yes.

But the age of 'assigning' anything is dead, even though you'll see
zombies roaming the landscape that still use it.

Welcome --- *assignment* --- to my list of stupid words.
