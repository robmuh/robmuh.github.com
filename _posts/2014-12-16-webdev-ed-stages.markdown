title: Learning Webdev is Easier with Jade, Stylus, and Prepros
---

It may seem backward, but teaching [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) and
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) before teaching HTML
and CSS is actually easier for students to grok &mdash; plus with
[PrePros](http://prepros.io) and it's instant gratification students
have so much more fun watching changes take place instantly before
their eyes.

# Simple is Easier to Learn

The same reason that Python makes such a great first programming
language Jade and Stylus make focusing on the concept and tags much
easier &mdash; particularly for young students. If you have spent
any time reading up the the philosophy behind code.org and Blockly
they you may have been convinced removing as many distractions from
learning the concepts up front has value.  Surely it does not
insulate the student from learning proper syntax and being able to
type language constructs correctly, but the initial impression is
gentler. Jade and Stylus follow on this idea and when adding PrePros
you can see immediately the resulting HTML formatted perfectly in
the Chrome source inspector.

# Blog Without an Engine

The Jade + Stylus + PrePros combo makes creating a blog on GitHub not only
remarkably easy, but very educational. While I haven't converted this blog
from GitHub pages yet it is just a matter of time. This combination allows
immediate previewing of blog posts and other web pages and a simple `git
commit` and `git push` posts the final version without any dependency on
GitHub pages or any other blogging engine for that matter. Blogging can be
a great way to promote web development skills using these industry
standard preprocessor formats and fosters less dependence on any particular
blogging system.
