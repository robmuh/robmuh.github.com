title: Nano Schools
subtitle: 1-3 Teacher Student Ratios
---

Could the solution to the world-wide education crisis come in very small
packages? Nano schools maximize mentor-learner attention with a 1-3 ratio.

Ever since I read Daniel Pink's [Free Agent Nation][] the term
'nano-business' has stuck with me. He describes this idea of people
purposefully keeping their businesses small --- really small --- like
it's just me small. The term 'micro-business' has been around a while
and implies more people involved. It's not surprising then that
[micro-schooling][] has been around a while and had success in
primarily progressive areas. So I'll call this model we use at
[SkilStak][] a nano-school, since it is mostly just one guy, me.

### It's About Attention

Humans evolved to learn from one another by one demonstrating to the
others and then passing that knowledge down. Apprenticeship has been
the naturally evolved method of education from the very beginning. Yet
somehow we've moved away from it. Why?

One thing seems for sure though, anything more than 1-3 ratio and someone
is being left out. At SkilStak, even with 42" screens on the wall so I can
see every single keystroke I still miss something or a student will stray.
I simply cannot imagine how anyone learns anything with 40 students in a
single class.

### Three, It's a Magic Number, Yes It Is

Not 4, not 2 unless you continue to 3, 5 is right out. There is probably a
more entertaining ethereal explanation for it, but I've observed this is
the perfect number to encourage teaming, a little healthy peer pressure,
and enough intimacy to promote risk-taking and not be intimidated by
having mistakes laid bare for everyone to see.

### It's About Personal Investment

Nothing like a sense of ownership in a project motivates more. Research,
such as that in *Drive*, overwhelmingly confirms we do and learn more
when we care more. Keeping learning nano-size means **both** the mentor
and the team of learners are enjoying what they are doing because they
are *choosing* to do it. Don't like something? Change it. The only
rule is that what you are doing should sometimes keep you up at night
thinking about it.

### It's About Real Human Interaction

When schools are nano-sized there is no forgetting names. I have
witnessed otherwise excluded kids come together with a common interest
and become very close friends in a non-threatening atmosphere ideal
for fostering relationships between all involved and closely linked
with those parents as well. There is no need for parent-teacher
conferences because it happens every week.

### Nano-Education is Concentrated Education

Studies have shown (which I'll eventually link) that as little as
two hours is all the actually learning that takes place during a regular
school day --- two hours! Imagine if even four hours of our day was
dedicated to learning when we were kids, and even a couple hours on
the weekend as adults. We really are never done learning.

Nano-education at this level --- motivated by project-based
self-investment --- maximizes the learning during those smaller
sessions. As we accept this we are able to take on more 1-3 learning
teams throughout the day if our day job happens to be education or
just one team if we have another day job.

### Socially Distributed Education

Share the load, pay it forward, what if we all did it? This has
nothing to do with distance education, although it could be done
through distance education using today's tools.

One of the reasons the current school systems fail is way too much of
the load and expectation is placed on them. What if we all shouldered
just a nano-bit of that burden once a week? Could it maybe even bring
us closer together as humans, even happier?

### Teaching And Learning are Very Satisfying

You know they are. You don't need someone to tell you that or prove it. The
act of having someone want to learn something you happen to know is
very validating. And the act of gaining new skills *that you care
about* is always supremely fun. Think how much happier we might all be
if we did this.

### The Technology is Just A Plus

Originally I remember sharing these ideas with someone in K-12 education,
how we could build something, I called it MentorMe at the time , a system
to connect those who want to learn, (which is largely everyone), with
those who want to mentor, (which is also everyone), in a way that they
could exchange credits of some kind that could literally be paid forward
to buy education in an area that they also wanted. I would still like to
see such a system emerge.

### Nobody's Stopping You

Today's homeschooling laws are getting smart about allowing parents to
find innovation in education on their own --- and it's spreading. Those
who know are finding time to teach, to share, to help anyone else
learn. Because learning happens in as little at 90 minute sessions
once or twice per week all the laws about licensing and child-care and
such don't apply. Trust is key (as Pink would agree). The risk of
impropriety is virtually eliminated by the nano-scale, which doesn't
work if all involved do not implicitly trust one another --- something
painfully absent from public and some other private education
alternatives.

In other words, go do it. Really, just do it. You know something and
you know there are others out there that need and want to learn it.
Find your super power, organize it a bit, then give it to others. At
the end of the day we are all rock stars in something. Maybe it's time
we gave a little back.
