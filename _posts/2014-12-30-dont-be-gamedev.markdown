title: Don't Be a Game Developer
subtitle: My Secret Ironic Hope
---

I built SkilStak Coding Arts based on the love of games and game
development but I secretly hope none of my students actually become
game developers, unless they are creating games with a purpose.
There is just so much more the world needs besides another first-person
shooter&mdash;or God forbid, another GTA.

I have a confession to make. I really don't play that many games.
Yes I've been through the Dota2 obsession and enjoy Team Fortress
2 with my boys online.  But does not playing games make me a hypocrite
&mdash; or worse &mdash; a sham? Nah, just sneaky and subversive.

## Even Hard Core Game Developers Don't Play Much

You know what? I'm not the only one. I've heard core game developers
on some of the most amazing games ever created, including the
upcoming [Evolve](http://evolvegame.com/), state on camera that
they don't play games that often. "It's more challenging to make
them," said one developer from [Turtle Rock](http://turtlerockstudios.com)
in a video interview.

## Consumer v.s. Creator

The thrill of creating something is always better than using or
consuming something. This is why sandbox games are so addictive.
They feed our inner need to create, which contrary to popular
thinking, is stronger and more persistent than the urge to destroy.

But despite the motivation, creators rule the world. Creators make
their own rules, literally sometimes. Creators give birth to new
ideas, technology, and art. Consumers devour. Consumers rage for
more. Consumers are the 'bitches' of creators.

## What You Create Matters

Game developers are clearly creators but so are crappy Hollywood
Film producers. Then there are the creators of YouTube videos, Slim
Jims, Bud Lite, and Kia automobiles. I don't mean to be obvious,
(oh wait, I do), people create crap. While I am approaching the
topic better entertained by the Game Theory guy, whatever his name
is, the point is there are different kinds of games and apps to
make and unfortunately too many are obsessed winning the coolest
and sometimes simultaneously the most useless award.

## Make Something Cool and Useful

I have always been open with my not-so-evil-plan-to-rule-the-world.
It is to raise up an army of technologists creating and supporting the
worlds best, most playable, e-d-u-c-ational games. (That's me having
a hard time even typing that horrendous word.) The games I want to
see created would be so playable and awesome that not even the most
discerning gamer/consumer could tell. This has been tried many times
before and failed miserably. Gamers and teens can smell 'education'
in their game ruining the learning and the game. It's like when you
spray fruity air-freshener after having spent 10 minutes filling
the toilet boil in your bathroom, with digested gluten and broccoli
let's say. It still smells like crap, just fruity crap. Such is the
case with most games that are educational and try to trick unsuspecting
gamers into playing them in their free time.

## Here's Some Ideas, Now Go Make Them

So what am I talking about?

How about a rated first-person-ish shooter (with a gore setting)
in which the baddies respond to different chemicals, real chemicals
that require knowledge of reactive properties of elements complete
with a periodic table HUD and weapons that can be calibrated by
mapping covalent bonds and molecules using standard notation from
Chem 101? You could build in test weapons to sample the boss's
reaction to bases v.s. acids say.

What about something more simple? Good 'ol breakout but using the
maps of the world as tiles that do interesting things when they are
bounced with the pong-ish ball. Maybe the way the state responds
to being hit is different depending on dangerously-generalized
cultural clich&eegu;s like Texas taking several hits and a 'Yeeeeha'
when it drops. It might not win a lot of awards, but it would give
that kid on his iPad next to you on that flight something to do
more than Temple Run.

How about Code Drone Commander (one that I'm actually working on)
where you combine the best elements of a 2.5D or 3D tower-defense
game with actual code to create complicated programs to navigate
the drone successfully to it's destination doing missions that have
relevance to a larger single-player story line.

## Do Something More

Even better would be for my students to grow out of their obsession
with making games, like I also had as a kid, and realizing all this
code they have learned can be used to program robots to bring
manufacturing back to the United States; to forecast economic,
climate, and other change; to bring people together; to analyze and
create cures for disease; to build magnificent real things and more.
