title: Don't Be a Game Developer
subtitle: My Secret Ironic Hope
---

Basic game development is probably the biggest foundation on which
I built SkilStak but I secretly hope none of my students actually
become game developers, unless they are creating games with a
purpose. There is just so much more the world needs besides another
first-person shooter.

I have a confession to make. I really don't play that many games.
Yes I've been through the Dota2 obsession and enjoy Team Fortress
2 with my boys online.  But does not playing games make me a hypocrite
&mdash; or worse &mdash; a sham? Nah, just sneaking and subversive.

## Even Hard Core Game Developers Don't Play Much

You know what? I'm not the only one. I've heard core game developers
on some of the most important games ever created, including the
upcoming [Evolve](http://evolvegame.com/), which I personally am
looking forward too, state on camera that they don't play games
that often.  "It's more challenging to make them," said one developer
from [Turtle Rock](http://turtlerockstudios.com) in a video interview.

## Consumer v.s. Creator

The thrill of creating something is always better than using or
consuming something. This is why sandbox games are so addictive.
They feed our inner need to create, which contrary to popular
thinking, is stronger and more persistent than the urge to destroy.

But despite the motivation, creators rule the world. Creators make
their own rules, literally sometimes. Creators give birth to new
ideas, technology, and art. Consumers devour. Consumers rage for
more. Consumers are the 'bitches' of creators.

## What You Create Matters

Game developers are clearly creators but so are crappy Hollywood
Film producers and directors, those who create reality shows. Then
there are the creators of YouTube videos, Slim Jims, Bud Lite, and
Kia automobiles. I don't mean to be obvious, (oh wait, I do), people
create crap. While I am approaching the topic better entertained
by the Game Theory guy, whatever his name is, the point is there
are different kinds of games and apps to make and unfortunately too
many are obsessed winning the coolest and sometimes simultaneously
the most useless award.

## Make Something Cool and Useful

I have always been open with my not-so-evil-plan-to-rule-the-world.
It is to raise up an army of technologists creating and support the
worlds best, most playable, e-d-u-c-ational games. (That's me having
a hard time even typing that horrendous word.) The games I want to
see created we be so playable and awesome that not even the most
discerning gamer/consumer could tell. This has been tried many times
before and failed miserably. Gamers and teens can smell 'education'
in their game ruining the learning and the game. It's like when you
spray fruity air-freshener after having spent 10 minutes filling
the toilet boil in your bathroom, with digested gluten and broccoli
let's say. It still smells like crap, just fruity crap. Such is the
case with most games that are educational and try to trick unsuspecting
gamers into playing them in their free time.
