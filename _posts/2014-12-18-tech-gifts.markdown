title: Gifts for Code Geeks
---

"Do you have any recommendations?" This is a question I get all the
time but sometimes have a hard time answering. The short answer is,
"Get them something that gets them to think like a programmer."
Here's a list of toys, games, and services that you might consider
for your favorite geek who particularly likes to program or wants
to learn.

# A Computer

This might seem obvious but I list it because kids as young as seven can
benefit from having daily access to an actual computer. Good computers are
even less than iPads and game consoles and are *much* better. The key is the
keyboard. Don't send your kid to school or SkilStak with *consolitis* unable
to even find the letter 'A' on the keyboard. Even the cheapest computer with
an actual keyboard teaches much more than the alternatives. Here's
a [buyers's guide](/buyers-guide/) I prepared earlier.

# Programming Software

While most programming languages are free there are tools to make
programming easier.

## Editors

A good text editor like Sublime is a nice stocking stuffer (although
it has a free version and VIM, the one true editor, which takes a
while to learn, is also free).

## Preprocessors

[Prepros](http://prepros.io) or [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/)
are great tools to help your webapp developer enjoy crafting web sites and
single-page-apps.

# Subscriptions

Most significant software or services these days are based on
subscriptions.

## Adobe Creative Cloud

Several amazing services are available as monthly or yearly
subscriptions.  Perhaps the most important is Adobe Creative Cloud,
which lets your budding game developer or graphic artist learn *the*
professional tool of the trade. Adobe CC is particularly valuable
because you can use *any* of Adobe's software including video
editing, web development, animation, and more.

## Digital Ocean

For as little as $5/month you can give your coder their own Linux
machine in the cloud. This includes a place to manage another
potential gift idea, a domain name. You know, like skilstak.com or
google.com or icode.com.

## More

So there are a lot more, but I'm tired of typing.
