"Hack what?" I would have said a few months ago after I buckled
down and started [SkilStak Coding Arts][]. "Hack Schools" someone
would explain to me. "What?"I didnt't start SkilStak, Inc. because it was the cool new thing,
the up and coming model for education. In fact, I had no fracking
idea these things existed. But they do and it is a good thing and
a bad thing that they do.

Recently I read this [fantastic article][] from fastcompany.com that
makes no quams about the good and bad of this new phenomenon. It is
really worth the read. Here's why.

### Take Your 50s Educational System and Shove It

Today's generations, myself included, have much more than an irreverant
animosity toward the industrial age education model some still want to
shoving down our throats based on old, irrellevant research. The current
system is [horribly broken][] and the only way
it will ever really improve is by realists throwing the whole fucking
thing out the window. (Ok, pretend I said that last sentence with
a nice British accent like Ken's.) This is exactly what hack schools
are doing, throwing the whole system out the window.

### "Death is the single best invention of life." (Steve Jobs)

Steve might not have been the best family man, but he understood
something important about progress.

It is just too hard to rid oneself of old scripts, let alone an entire
system conceived by an industrial age of war. The current system ain't
dead yet, but the explosion of "hack schools" just might be signally
the end, or at least an evolution.

### But wait ...

A lot of these hack schools just suck. The greatest fear of the
establishment, and the foundation of failed programs like "No Child
Left Behind" is *fear*, fear that somehow, those providing the
education will just pass people, fear that people completing these
programs won't have enough actual experience to be worth hiring, and
fear that the system will fail, ironically.

The ugly truth is that some people do fail, but no one hears about it,
as the article calls out. Which is why just a high-paid hack school is
not enough.

### Promise Less, Deliver More

One of the things I enjoy about SkilStak's success so far has been
that we simply don't raise expectations for becoming a millionaire
over night, only that students will have a concentrated environment in
which to learn things that other schools are simply not teaching. We
don't require payment up front and I am the first person to encourage
someone who's interest is waning to find something that keeps them up
at night (like SkilStak does for most) rather than adding another
have-to to the list of expectations.

### I have <s>A</s> My Own Dream

I have been dreaming for years of beginning an educational career of
some kind and always hitting barriers of some kind in the process.

Perhaps the biggest barrier was my very public divorce after some
three years of complete obsession with virtual worlds for business and
education as (the now infamous) [Mo Hax][]. I ran virtual world
playgrounds for [NCTIES][] had educator campfires on my own island
[EDTECH Retreat][] and attended [ISTE][] conferences with friends of
all types with a common vision for education and keeping the human
element in the run-away successful distance learning mega-trends.

Then this.

SkilStak is so fulfilling and so successful because it is so tangible.
The faces of students learning, often when another student shares what
they learned last week, is real, palpable, and more encouraging than
anything I could have imagined.

Thanks universe for this opportunity, now back to work.
