title: Scratch Misses the Itch
subtitle: Why MIT's Scratch 'Programming' Language Might Be a Waste of Time
---

MIT and others are shifting to use Python to introduce programming. Why
not do the same for even the youngest future coders instead of
Scratch.

I mean no disrespect to a tool that has introduced probably hundreds of
thousands to programming at this point but the cutesy Scratch platform
(I just cannot bring myself to call it a language) seems like a waste
of time &mdash; especially after seeing first-hand how future coders
as young as seven, who can barely type, can code in Python and usually
enjoy it more and for better reasons.

### Never Been a Fan

I have to confess I have never really liked Scratch for much the same
reasons I never liked Pascal. The idea of creating a language just to
teach programming seems, well, stupid &mdash; especially when a *real*
language exists that can do the same thing. These 'educational' languages
fall into the over-thinking-education category for me. 

This makes Python such a no-brainer decision these days that it is
has virtually pushed Java out of the schools as the first real language
people learn.

### Don't Baby Them

If code language learning compares to foreign language learning
(and I think it does) then Scratch is like baby-talking your kid to
death until they are 11. You've met these kids &mdash; the ones that
baby-talk into their teens because their parents were cutesy, clingy
idiots. You can love and teach a child without babying them.

Kids don't really like to be babied anyway and that is exactly what
Scratch is. Ever had a 12-month-old old swat your hand to stop you from
helping them walk? "I got this, bitch!" (Okay, I'm sure they aren't
actually thinking that, at least let's hope they're not)

If a kid can hunt and peck and is motivated (by great content) then she
won't want to learn the baby-talk of programming languages &mdash;
especially when she sees the bigger coders using a *real* language. In
fact, you might just get your hand swatted again.

And the older coders? Well, they already have Java (Minecraft) or C#
(Unity3D) or JavaScript (webapps) or Bash (admin) in their sites and want
to get through Python so they can get to the other grown-up languages
(which Python also is). God help you as a teacher if you try to force
Scratch down these guys' throats.

### Syntax, Syntax, Syntax

Scratch is intended in part to insulate programmers from code syntax,
the magical symbols and words of *real* code. But this is
a disservice. The sooner these kids learn what a parenthesis is, or
a colon, and that a star means multiply the better they will actually
speak the language of *real* code. Scratch delays learning these
things unnecessarily.

### Content Wins Over Cute

The biggest argument for Scratch over code is the content. There is
a lot of it, drum beats, dance parties, animations, pictures. These
are fun things, but they are **not** code. In the time it takes to
pick out a fat drum beat a motivated coder could have learned if and
else statement syntax &mdash; and with the same vigor provided the
same self-investment in the outcome exists.

This is very important. Kids learning Scratch are motivated by making
things happen visually on the screen. Kids learning raw-code are
motivated by logic and code organization, by whit and cleverness.
I personally witnessed one future coder abandon programming and
Scratch after getting a great dance party to happen on the screen,
without any thought to the order or execution. Another in that same
class latched on to the idea of creating an interactive quiz about
horses and continues to come motivated to add more multiple choice
questions about horses with witty responses and tricks for those
taking it &mdash; in Python.

Yes we have become largely a visual society but that does not mean
there is still very interesting and motivating value in simple text
interactions. Python teaches kids to think more than Scratch and for
more valuable reasons.

### Better Visual Options

If you do feel a graphically rich and immediately satisfying tool is
warranted then use Gamemaker Studio of Unity 3D. These tools are used
by professionals as well as being relatively easy to use &mdash;
especially Gamemaker Studio with its rich drag-and-drop options that
can be directly translated later into their code equivalents. Your
students benefit best because they take those new skills with them and
can immediately produce amateur and professional games rather than
having to relearn a new tool after being forced to learn Scratch
(and/or Alice) first.

### Expect More

I've been told I hold even my youngest coders to very high expectations. I
suppose I'm a little spoiled. I expect every student at SkilStak to
become a programmer no matter the age and because I run a private school
if kids don't want to code they leave, one way or another. At this point
dozens of kids have had their 'code birthday' here, a *real* birthday,
even if that is just coding ...

```python
print('Hello world!')
```

To me learning Scratch simply doesn't count as 'first code.'  Imagine
these coders when they are 24 talking to their university friends about
when they started to code:

    "Oh I started Scratch when I was seven."
    
    "Awwww cute. That's when I coded my first small Python app.
    Wanna see it on GitHub?"

Which do you want to be? Which do you want for those you are helping
to learn?

And to you coder moms out there: which would you rather have, a pretty
mother's day card in Scratch that your child made by playing with
pictures, picking sounds, and making things move without typing nearly
a thing; or an interactive, text-based quiz or story written about you
entirely in Python including function definitions, conditional logic flow,
and actual written code that they've saved to GitHub? I am sure you
would be pleased with both and support whatever your child does to
learn and express their love for you but one of these gifts taught
your child more as she made it.
