title: Scratch Misses the Itch
subtitle: Why MIT's Scratch Might Be a Waste of Time
---

MIT and others are shifting to use Python to introduce programming. Why
not do the same for even the youngest future coders instead of
Scratch.

I mean no disrespect to a tool that has introduced probably hundreds of
thousands to programming at this point but the cutesy Scratch platform
(I just cannot bring myself to call it a language) seems like a waste
of time &mdash; especially after seeing first-hand how future coders
as young as seven, who can barely type, can code in Python and usually
enjoy it more and for better reasons.

### Computational Thinking: When Scratch Works

Computational thinking does not come to everyone naturally. This is
something I had to realize talking with others and observing students.
Breaking a problem down into parts and creating logical flows and
algorithms has to be learned even if, like me, you can't remember when
and where it was that you learned it.

I have sat and watched students solve problems on
[studio.code.org](http://studio.code.org) through trial and error and
have witnessed them learning computational thinking before my eyes. This
particular approach to visual programming does not require any
typing skills. It is fun, engaging, and low-danger. My conclusion
based on this experience is that kids as young at
four can learn how to think like a programmer without typing a word.
For this young group Scratch
and the like are ideal, a way to play with computers that doesn't
promote console-syndrome, that intellectual paralysis that comes
to kids that play nothing but XBox-ish games. 

Code Studio is fundamentally different than Scratch and Snap! in this
regard because it is focused on the very young, those that cannot
type. Scratch and Snap! require a fair amount of typing skill.

The key is structure, at least in the beginning.

The very structured problem-solving games at studio.code.org are also
something anyone can do completely unsupervised making this a great
extra to the code written together in the classroom. The same can be
accomplished with books like DK's great *Help Your Kids with Computer
Coding* and it's use of Scratch in a structured way to accomplish
a goal &mdash; especially as it leads directly into Python making
visual comparisons between the two.

### Never Been a Fan

I have to confess I have never really liked Scratch for much the same
reasons I never liked Pascal. The idea of creating a language just to
teach programming seems, well, stupid &mdash; especially when a *real*
language exists that can do the same thing. These 'educational' languages
fall into the over-thinking-education category for me. 

This makes Python such a no-brainer decision these days that it is
has virtually pushed Java out of the schools as the first real language
people learn.

### Don't Baby Them

If code language learning compares to foreign language learning
(and I think it does) then Scratch is like baby-talking your kid to
death until they are 11. You've met these kids &mdash; the ones that
baby-talk into their teens because their parents were cutesy, clingy
idiots. You can love and teach a child without babying them.

Kids don't really like to be babied anyway and that is exactly what
Scratch is. Ever had a 12-month-old old swat your hand to stop you from
helping them walk? "I got this, bitch!" (Okay, I'm sure they aren't
actually thinking that, at least let's hope they're not)

If a kid can hunt and peck and is motivated (by great content) then she
won't want to learn the baby-talk of programming languages &mdash;
especially when she sees the bigger coders using a *real* language. In
fact, you might just get your hand swatted again.

And the older coders? Well, they already have Java (Minecraft) or C#
(Unity3D) or JavaScript (webapps) or Bash (admin) in their sites and want
to get through Python so they can get to the other grown-up languages
(which Python also is). God help you as a teacher if you try to force
Scratch down these guys' throats.

### Syntax, Syntax, Syntax

Scratch is intended in part to insulate programmers from code syntax,
the magical symbols and words of *real* code. But this is
a disservice. The sooner these kids learn what a parenthesis is, or
a colon, and that a star means multiply the better they will actually
speak the language of *real* code. Scratch delays learning these
things unnecessarily.

### Content Wins Over Cute

The biggest argument for Scratch over code is the content. There is
a lot of it, drum beats, dance parties, animations, pictures. These
are fun things, but they are **not** code. In the time it takes to
pick out a fat drum beat a motivated coder could have learned if and
else statement syntax &mdash; and with the same vigor provided the
same self-investment in the outcome exists.

This is very important. Kids learning Scratch are motivated by making
things happen visually on the screen. Kids learning raw-code are
motivated by logic and code organization, by whit and cleverness.
I personally witnessed one future coder abandon programming and
Scratch after getting a great dance party to happen on the screen,
without any thought to the order or execution. Another in that same
class latched on to the idea of creating an interactive quiz about
horses and continues to come motivated to add more multiple choice
questions about horses with witty responses and tricks for those
taking it &mdash; in Python.

Yes we have become largely a visual society but that does not mean
there is still very interesting and motivating value in simple text
interactions. Python teaches kids to think more than Scratch and for
more valuable reasons.

### Better Visual Options

If you do feel a graphically rich and immediately satisfying tool is
warranted then use Gamemaker Studio or Unity3D or KhanAcademy's
JavaScript lessons using the ProcessingJS engine, and Python's own
turtle graphics, PyGame, and especially Kivy frameworks. Sure you can
hold their hands to help jump the puddles of setting up these tools.
But once setup, they are using the same tools used by professionals even
though, like Gamemaker Studio, they come with beginner-friendly drag-and-drop options that
can be directly translated later into their code equivalents. Your
students benefit best because they take those new skills with them and
can immediately produce amateur and professional games rather than
having to relearn a new tool after being forced to learn Scratch, Alice,
Snap or whatever other academically-invented distraction is out there.
As a student I would take being taught a language constructed by a
well-informed engineer (even if it was BASIC) to do real things
(including fun graphic things) that the scientific community (and others)
have overwhelmingly adopted (yes Python is the darling of scientists) over
any insular language designed for nothing more than to provide 'a good
introduction to computational thinking even if they never code again',
which brings me to another rant ...

### Teachers' Crutch?

I realize what I'm about to write will be considered fighting words by
some, but I can't not. For whatever reason, most teachers' I have observed, who are tasked
with teaching others to program, simply have no idea how to write
actual code themselves. I think this is a fault of the system more
than any teacher. I was on IRC with a guy that had been thrown into
teaching Java because he has written a few lines of it in college even
though he was a history teacher. The school 'volunteered' him to come up
with an entire 'code club' program. He was in way over his head but
wanted to help and was desperate. He and others begged me to write
a book to specifically help these teachers thrown into teaching
programming who have never actually done it.

This is just embarrassing.

The future of our world and nation depends on these skills and not
only are they not taught in schools, the teachers could not teach them
if we wanted them to. And you can bet as soon as *any* of them learn
even rudimentary programming it will be really hard for them not to
bail for an entry-level programming job making almost double their
teacher salary. Our system of education is horribly broken and will
never be fixed as long as that dynamic exists (which I rant about in
another post about why [nano-schools](http://robmuh.com/nano-schools)
and a different fundamental approach might be the answer).

### Expect More

Why are we making cutesy tools for colleges to 'get to' students that
will drop programming after their first class in it? (according to one
line of thinking expressed by a proponent of Snap in colleges).

There are two
general groups, those that will continue to program and really eat it
up, those that do not consider themselves programmers and sincerely
don't want anything to do with it. The
we-want-them-to-love-playing-to-keep-coding approach ultimately
punishes the first group so the second group can play and maybe learn
something.

Some of the most amazing programmers I have ever met were Russian,
Romanian, Indian, Chinese and Polish. By all accounts these are our main
competitors for programming jobs. Ask any of them what they think of
Scratch and this uniquely American way of coddling our future coders
at the expense of identifying and teaching real programmers.
Scratch puts these guys and gals actually behind in comparison.

I've been told I hold even my youngest coders to very high expectations. I
suppose I'm a little spoiled. I expect every student at SkilStak to
become a programmer no matter the age and because I run a private school
if kids don't want to code they leave, one way or another. At this point
dozens of kids have had their 'code birthday' here, a *real* birthday,
even if that is just coding ...

```
print('Hello world!')
```

To me learning Scratch simply doesn't count as 'first code.'  Every
time code.org videos lie to kids and tell them they just 'wrote' so
many lines of code I have to stifle a grimace. The verb 'write' to
most objective humans means you used a pencil, pen, or typed
something. Saying you 'wrote' 160 lines of code.org code by snapping
blocks together in a GUI editor is a bald-faced lie, and worse, one
that they encourage kids to brag about. Imagine
these coders when they are 24 talking to their university friends about
when they started to code:


    "Oh I started Scratch when I was seven. I wrote 300 lines of code."
    
    "You mean you snapped together a few blocks without every typing 
    out a for loop. Cute. That's when I coded my first small Python app.
    Wanna see it on GitHub?"

Which do you want to be? Which do you want for those you are helping
to learn?

And to you coder moms out there: which would you rather have, a pretty
mother's day card in Scratch that your child made by playing with
pictures, picking sounds, and making things move without typing nearly
a thing; or an interactive, text-based quiz or story written about you
entirely in Python including function definitions, conditional logic flow,
and actual written code that they've saved to GitHub? I am sure you
would be pleased with both and support whatever your child does to
learn and express their love for you but one of these gifts taught
your child more as she made it.

### Conclusion

If your students cannot type start with Scratch and Blockly. 
If your students can type, even a little, start with Python.
Simple code is not hard. Supplement with Scratch and
languages like it but only if it does not slow them down in learning
a real language. If during the first month you identify students that
really hate Python or just can't learn to match a parenthesis or
include a semicolon then put them in the remedial Scratch-ish program,
otherwise, don't punish the rest of the students with baby talk.
