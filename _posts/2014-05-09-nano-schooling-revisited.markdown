title: Nano-Schooling Group Sizes Revisited
---

Preferred group sizes for nano-schooling varies with age, personality, and
session type.

This continual education experiment here at [SkilStak](http://skilstak.com)
has recently brought me to some very real, (yet unscientific),
discoveries about group size. Most will fall into the 'no-duh' category
for you readers with more experience than I.

## Decibels

"Learning is noisy" to paraphrase Sir Ken Robinson. While this may be
true there is a point at which organic, noisy education gets in the
way for others in the group. In general, teens and adults are quieter
than pre-teens therefore keeping the size of young groups down and
never mixing them seems to work better even if they have no personal
problem being together.

Yes teens, adults, and even seniors can get very rowdy but less
predictably and generally in ways that the others in the group can
accept or participate in.

## Focus

Teens and adults simply from their maturity have gained the ability,
generally, to stay on task and work independently. This means less
need to constantly monitor their learning and bring them back on task,
which is notably more pronouced in those 14 and under. "See this
remarkably simple responsive web app? 1-day, $300. Now learn this
stuff so you can make them."

I noticed that restoring focus is different for the age groups. Teens and
adults react well to reminders particularly involving money to be earned
by learning the skill they have set out to master. Those younger are more
motivated by pure fun and 'street cred' with their peers they will gain by
mastering their goals. "That's hilarious, what if it did <blank>?
People would play that forever."

## Social Dynamics

This is by far the most fascinating for me. Just two pre-teens, who
aren't related or don't have a long history together already, can get
downright aggresive with each other in almost a competition for my
attention as they learn. It's like sybling rivalry I imagine, but can
get worse. They don't actually get mean in the traditional sense, just
very aggresive. If you add one other to the group they are still
aggresive for attention but tend to not get personal, or even physical
in their struggle.

Teens are more subtle in their need for attention and will simply not even
ask for it even if they need or want it. I've found I have to go around to
each in a non-threatening way to just observe progress and they will bring
up questions at that point. Rarely will they raise their hand and ask a
question even in groups of two. The need to appear completely able and
to already know everything seems to trump actual learning level, which
means more checks of their mastery. 

However, having one teen teach another is not nearly as effective with
teens and adults as it is with those younger. I don't understand why
this is really. It is probably some deep commentary on the nature of
human development and competition v.s. cooperation in our society.

## Caveats

To be fair, I've not yet had a group of all girls to compare to the
all boy teen groups.

## What if more teachers experienced teaching different age groups?

It occurred to be analyzing all of this that I may one of the lucky
few who gets an opportunity to experience how others learn at
different ages. It taught me to handle them differently from
everything to communication styles, approach, and subject matter.
I think this insight would be something more educators would want to
experience for themselves somehow.
