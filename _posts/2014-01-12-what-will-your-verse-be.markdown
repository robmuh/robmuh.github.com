There is perhaps no more life-affirming movie in my top ten more
powerful than [Dead Poet Society][], premium art in it's storytelling and
provocative, tragic, plot. Leave it to Apple to connect it to what
makes all the tools and noise valuable, their ability to facilitate
poetry.

Have you found what makes work, education, and life worth living for?
