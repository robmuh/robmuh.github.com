title: Text Editors and IDEs for Programming
---

Seems like a trivial thing to a lot of programmers, but if you are
starting out making a good decision about the editor and/or IDE you
use for a given language can be daunting. Here's help.

First off here are the languages we at SkilStak Coding Arts consider
worth learning and in the order we generally introduce them. The
editors listed are in order of preference based on ease of use. (We are
talking about initially 7-year-old coders, so yeah). The editor
recommendation is not only based on ease of adoption but what a coder
is most likely to encounter in the working world:

* [Python][] - IDLE, NotePad++, VIM
* Java - Eclipse, VIM
* HTML5 - NotePad++, VIM
* CSS3 - NotePad++, VIM
* JavaScript/Node - NotePad++, VIM
* Bash - VIM
* Perl - VIM
* C/C++ - VIM, VisualStudio
* C# - MonoDevelop, VisualStudio
* PHP - NotePad++, VIM

Of course there are other languages, but we currently don't concern
ourselves with them at SkilStak. Even though some of these might not
be my personal favorites, they are clearly and fundamentally relevant
to today's technology requirements. In other words, if you learn them
you can easily get a job and get paid to code in them.

## Not So Sublime

Note SublimeText has fallen off (although I paid for it). The creator
has long since abandoned regular updates (infuriating the plugin
community with his lack of responsiveness and release of the code to open
source). It is also insanely complicated to setup when the very reason
a lot of people use it is for easy of use. For example, configuring
SublimeTextREPL to run Python properly requires an ungodly amount
of setup (which I actually had all my students do) v.s. just opening
Python IDLE or NotePad++ and just having everything work. Once again,
we are talking about those as young as seven doing this. Anyone who
can actually configure SublimeText to do more probably would be able
to tackle VIM without a much more difficulty, which carries tons more
usability and utility for the person learning it.

Sublime is heavily used in the web development world, but one reason I
find this annoying is that all my favorite syntax formats (Jade, Stylus)
are not supported out of the box, You either want syntax highlighting
or can live without it. If you want it with SublimeText you need a lot
of plugin install and configuration. If I am going to that much trouble
to configure something might as well just use VIM or give it up and use
NotePad++ for those not ready to make the VIM leap.

There are also alternatives like Brackets from Adobe that are looking
promising.
