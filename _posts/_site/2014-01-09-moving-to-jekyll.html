<p><a href="">Jekyll</a> caught my eye more than a year ago, about the same time <a href="">GitHub</a> did. I’ll save my rant about how ironic it is that the cool <em>new</em> thing on the Web is static sites and blog engines. Anyone remember how cool guestbooks were back in ‘94? Anyway, it was enough to get me wanting to do an entire static blog engine of my own, (which you might notice on my GitHub). But teaching at the college and a few days of holiday vacation convinced me to just use GitHub pages, which includes Jekyll. These days I use GitHub daily for my commits for about everything, updating my web site and blog then become simply matters.</p>

<p>To all my new students in 2014, let me say hello and wish you the best while I finish fleshing this thing out. Go ahead. Give it a try as well. I’ll even give you extra credit. <em>grin</em></p>
