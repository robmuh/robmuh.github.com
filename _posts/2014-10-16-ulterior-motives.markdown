I want to create talented programmers who apply what they know to who they
are and who they will become, not just to making games.

Recently I was reminded why I have always been about teaching particularly
school-age kids programming through their love of games, not just to make
games. In fact, I hope they never code games in their lives after leaving
SkilStak unless it is for fun with their family and friends to teach them
coding as well.

### Most Gamers Suck, and Not Just the Noobs

Honestly, most gamers I meet &mdash; especially online behind the
cloak of anonymity &mdash; are illiterate, assholes who couldn't use a
semicolon properly to save their lives. If you are one, well, I'm not
sorry I said so. (Now go read a book.) If you aren't, then I'm sorry
you had to read the sorry cynical side of my personality. There's a
reason many of the best game developers themselves don't play a lot
of video games (as is voiced in one documentary about indy and 'big
house' game development). They enjoy the challenge of creation more
than winning. Games can stimulate. They can also destroy, which may
explain the sad, sorry personalities of those who have come to think
their behavior is acceptable when it just isn't.

Don't think you are immune. 

### Minecraft

Why is Minecraft so wildly popular despite the perplexing 8-bit look
and feel? Because it is about building, customization and being creative
with limited resources. Creating is exponentially more satisfying than
destroying or dominating. To speak clich√©, there are no losers, only
winners.

### I Don't Want to Create Gamers

I really don't. I want to create programmers, epic code masters with the
power and desire to change the world, not dominate it (despite my jokes
about our 'plans to rule the world' here at SkilStak, meaning to introduce
the world to coding by spreading a love and understanding of it virally).

Yes making games is satisfying, but so is visualizing the particles
revealed in a mass spectrometer or imbuing robots with the intelligence
to perform tasks or just to make a computer generate amazing interactive
art, which games are, of course.

Learning to program is only the beginning. The question is what will
you use your coding mastery for.

### SkilStak Coding Arts is About Programming, Not Games

Yes we love to game. We are even adding a gaming camp to learn the
subtleties of the most advanced strategy games out there. But SkilStak
never has been nor never will be about playing games other than as a means
to learn programming and build computational thinking skills. If anything
I hope our small army of programmers grows capable to make games that
educate and uplift without kids even knowing they aren't just playing
a game.

There are a lot of schools, some national, popping up that tie into
game development, some more than others, but in our case, SkilStak will
always be about programming first. We may not enjoy the mass appeal
of game-dev-only schools, but we don't need it. Our motives are pure,
learn programming to create whatever you dream of, the rest will follow.
