title: Technical Books are Dead
subtitle: And not just as in 'dead trees'
---

Since the dawn of the Internet books written about technology have
struggled to keep up. Learning to Google really well, identify
authoritative information sources, use Twitter and IRC, and &mdash;
most importantly &mdash; follow individuals who know what you want
to know trumps paying $50 for a book you hope will be up to date.
GitHub puts this over 9000 when you can literally follow every
commit the leading authorities in the field are making.

# Programming (OLD) Python

Recently I was reminded just how bad most technical books are
skimming through Programming Python. I saw rampant violation of
PEP-8 style guidelines, use of outdated examples (CGI, really?),
and the unforgivable omission of the most important GUI toolkit for
Python today, Kivy. This was compounded by the fact that I could
not find Mark Lutz on Twitter or anywhere else but his 90s-tilde-sporting
web page address. I've never met Mark and applaud his work in general
and admire him for coming from the same era as myself (although I
went the Perl route), but his 500 page books are dinosaur remnants
of an age now decidedly past, the age of technical book learning.

# Just in Time Learning

Today's technical pace demands paradigm shift to just-in-time
learning (a term I believe I've coined). For example, Code School
just spammed my in box with "New Express.js Course Has Launched!"
the same week I [watched Jonathan Ong trash
Express](http://youtu.be/bNVcVx8TfPc), which he helped build with
TJ, to explain KoaJS, clearly the successor to Express written by
the Express developers themselves. It still makes me laugh to realize
there were only 522 views of this video when it explains the most
important webapp development advance to come since Express based
on HTTP2/SPDY and the next version of JavaScript to come out in
2015. Nothing TJ or Jonathan are doing is really captured in any
book anywhere, nor would it be wise to do so.

# The More Things are the Same

This isn't anything new. In the 90s when the web came out there
were no books on HTML for years. I know. I checked every day at the
local bookstore.  We had to read the source code and make friends
with other developers on the Internet.

# What About Those First Starting?

When dealing with technical topics doing always wins over reading.
Reading is nice while consuming your favorite beverage or meal, but
even then books are not required. Tools like InstaPaper, YouTube,
Vimeo and others have given you the opportunity to follow the
information sources that are most relevant in real-time. But still,
what about those who haven't learned anything at all and don't know
how to begin? If this describes you then start with code.org,
codecademy.com, lynda.com, teamtreehouse.com and such. Another great
way to learn is spending a little money for thinkful.com if you
can't find an equivalent way to learn locally.  Mentorship will
always win over any book.

This goes even for parents and kids. This is compounded by the fact that
parents often come from a book-learning background and can't understand why
their son or daughter doesn't want to learn from the great book they found
for them. This is especially true for home schoolers. 

One specific example of this is [DK's Help Your Child to Learn
Computer
Coding](https://github.com/skilstak/dk-help-your-kids-with-computer-coding).
This flashy book that would grab anyone's attention on the shelf
is full of bad code and coding practices, practices that are
specifically called out as 'anti-idioms' in the official Python
documentation. I also seriously doubt that the Ph.D's listed at the
front of the book, which suspiciously are not directly noted as
'authors', had anything to do with the book. From top to bottom the
book is a marketing device more than a book of real substance. This
is the danger books carry for the unwary. I would never hire anyone
who coded the Bubble Blaster program in that book, not even for
beginning internship work. 

While I still mention this book to parent's when pressed since it
remains one of the better books for very young kids, I always
recommend they stick with other online, challenge-based learning
options, the official tutorials, and their own experimentation. It isn't
a hard sell because this is what most kids want anyway, instead of just
retyping what they see in a book.

# "I'm Afraid of Gaps"

Aren't we all. Truth is everyone in the technology field will have gaps of
some kind. Making sure those gaps are not critical is the key. Books are
good for one thing, reading the index to see the things that you need to
know even if you don't use the book to learn them. Another great source for
this is the official documents themselves. Python is great with this. If the
official docs do not exist or are too hard to grok then use the index at
least as a bullet-point list of things you know you need to learn, from the
Internet and/or a mentor.

# Old-Timers

I happen to be one. I can tell you there was a time when having a
colorful library of O'Reilly books was a very comforting feeling.
You knew that any problem that came your way could somehow be
addresses after a few minutes of reading from your library.

I talked Nike into buying me a full O'Reilly library instead of
waisting the money on a $2000 one week training session. Back then the books
were insurmountably important. Nowadays not so much. Everything I ever
learned in an O'Reilly book is now more easily obtainable from a simple
Internet search or an IRC query.

However, there are millions of technologists and managers that still
give more credence to a book and/or a certificate and/or a degree
than actual code you or someone else has written that is available
on GitHub or elsewhere. This is very unfortunate and a symptom of
a lingering clinging to 90s learning techniques. The best way to
shut these types up is to simply produce using your own methods of
learning without any regard to their learning biases they would
like to expect of you.
