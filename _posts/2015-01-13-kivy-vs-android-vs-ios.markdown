title: Kivy v.s. Android v.s. iOS
subtitle: (ok, so really Kivy v.s. native)
---

**UPDATE:** Kivy diminishes even further in relevance as hybrid
performance boosters like [Crosswalk](http://crosswalk-project.org)
get better and better. The gap between native and hybrid is closing
even faster than I expected.

I hate writing this. I really do. I *love* Kivy. But the harsh
reality that Facebook and so many others have realized is that if
you have anything more than an HTML5 single-page-app you should
skip hybrids (Kivy, Phonegap) and go native. Even if the technology
can compete nothing can compete with the financial backing of today's
largest technology giants waging war to gain the best and most
developers to their native Mobile App Development Platforms No
got-a-grant-this-year project will ever keep up, no matter how cool
or how cool/smart the developers.

## Nothing New

This is nothing new. Netscape beat NCSA. IE beat Netscape. Chrome
beat IE. Ubuntu beat RedHat. Apple beat IBM, Rio, and a dozen more.
Commercial backing destroys the competition. This isn't capitalist
dogma, it's just reality, a reality I sometimes really, really hate.

## It Doesn't Matter if You're the Best without Backing

Many would tell you that Beta was better than VHS, that Divx is far
better than BlueRay. Often the better technology still loses because
of corporate backing or counter-backing (like against the electric
car in the 70s). I really hate this fact as well.

## What does this have to do with Kivy and &mdash; more importantly
&mdash; SkilStak?

Kivy is cool, poorly backed, and mostly irrelevant. At SkilStak we
sort of obsess about only teaching current and emerging technology
and *real* tools as soon as students are able to use them. Kivy now
finds itself next to Dart, Processing, Lua, and, yes, Perl on the
really-cool-but-better-tool-exists shelf. Did I mention I hate that?
Know what else is there? Python IDLE. That's right, IDLE, not Python,
but more on that later.

Kivy has the best multi-touch cross-platform offerings of anything
I have seen. Kivy apps run on literally any device there, but Kivy
apps do require enough tweaking for each independent OS to torpedo
it's main strength besides the multi-touch, it's cross-platform
nature. As soon as you are doing something special to make your
Kivy app work on an iOS device different from an Android device you
are starting to wonder if you should have just built the whole thing
native &mdash; especially since it would undoubtedly perform better
than any hybrid.

Sure Kivy will maintain a niche with Pythonistas and data visualization
people particularly in the sciences and arts but those investing
in a long-term, mission-critical apps will be creating them in
HTML5, and when required, Java for Android and Swift/Objective-C
for iOS.

## What about Kivy for Games?

What about it? There are clearly better backed and better performing
alternatives. Why waste the time doing them in Kivy when you could
invest in learning Unity or GameMaker Studio, even Microsoft XNA?
Kivy is not, nor will ever be, an alternative to these mainstream
game development platforms.

## Android SDK and Java are Up a Notch (no Pun Intended)

Android's new IntelliJ SDK is amazing and Android's overwhelming
[dominance](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2460020/android-grabs-record-85-percent-smartphone-share.html)
of the Internet-of-things and smart-phone market is real and decisive.
Yes iPhone users will persist and a few will toy with Windows phones
but Android has already clearly won the war for the most prominent
app platform. What I think of this doesn't really matter, it's
simply the facts.

For SkilStak students this means a higher focus on Java, Scala, and
IntelliJ.
