My overwhelming excitement to discover
[CodeCombat.com](http://codecombat.com) was instantly
squelched when I saw the Python (default) language
uses camelCase, a gross violation of [PEP-8 Python style
guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008#function-names)
for no good reason. Then when considering it for JavaScript coding
I encountered their `loop {}` construct instead of an actual loop.
Conclusion: an incredibly cool looking flop. It fails to accomplish the
main goal of teaching correct programming. *UPDATE: Recently learned that
**all** of codecombat.com is released as [full open
source](http://codecombat.com/legal), so yeah, I'll be
running my own server and tweeking things to my likely eventually. Thanks!*

However, I was utterly blown away by the quality of HTML5 site and
everything it entails. The developers responsible are clearly masters
of web app and game development. The art of the game is also very
amazing. All the more reason I was grossly disappointed to realize that
getting my students excited about this tool would only serve to instill
practices I'd have to unteach them later and would ensure they fail any
job interview to become a programmer one day if they used them during
those interviews.

I don't need to write more. All anyone needs to know are these two things:

* Python uses camelCase
* JavaScript uses a `loop {}` construct instead of an actual loop syntax

I've informed the creators and I can't wait to see them spend real time with
actual computer science educators to correct these fatal flaws. The idea
behind what they are doing is amazing and I applaud those behind getting
this idea out there.
