I'd practically forgotten about the horrid
[w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com)
thanks to the [Chrome W3Schools Hider
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/w3schools-hider/igiahejkpbnbnekdaefddmdceocmjpll),
but when a local program to help kids become computer programmers
incorrectly referred to 'w3cschools.org' in their official marketing
materials I was reminded just how rampant the confusion still is.

Like most everyone reading this you will get a page full of links to
w3schools when you Google anything related to web technology. This is
because the for-profit company &mdash; with no affiliation whatsoever with
the official [World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/), which created and is responsible for
overall governance of web technology &mdash; decided to troll you into
thinking they actually know what they are talking about when, in fact, they
have done everything in their power to disassociate themselves officially
from the very community the pretend to represent. They prey on your
confusion.

### There is no w3cschools.org

Contrary to what this well-intentioned group of self-organized technology
parents wrote in this marketing material for a Summer camp, there
simply is no 'w3cshools.org' at all. (There is also no such site as
'codecedmy.com'; no words in the English language spelled 'materail';
and 'its' is a possessive, not a contraction of 'it is'.)

Suffice it to say they aren't the only ones confused.

### Enter W3Fools.com

Don't believe me? Read [what a group of respected web
professionals](http://w3fools.com) came together to create to warn you
of the danger of using W3Schools. I mean, how bad do you have to be to
have a community of your professed peers come together &mdash; including
the very organization overseeing the thing you are proposing to educate
people about &mdash; and denounce you publicly, but even more, to have
a subset of that community create tools to help themselves and others
eliminate you from every Google search made.

### I was once burned

Up until about two years ago I also read the stuff on w3schools.com.
Then I noticed some stuff that was just plain wrong. The more I looked the
more Googled to see if this was reliable information &mdash; especially
considering the monumental changes to the web with HTML5 &mdash; the
more I realized how much misinformation was there. I found w3fools.com,
added the Chrome extension and have never regretted it for one minute. You
should too.
