title: Wanted - Front End Developers
subtitle: The New Job Requirements
---

Once upon a time getting a tech job meant you needed lots of experience
and education, perhaps a degree or two. Times have changed, and for the
better, that is, if you know how to prepare and keep up. Here's what it
takes to get a job in ~~web~~ front-end development today.

The following is taken direct from a recent email sent from a local
recruiter:

    * Seeking a strong Javascript Developer
    * Coding skills are far more important that years of experience in the field. 
    * Junior, Mid-level, and Senior Developers are all welcome to apply.
    * Coding in Native Javascript is key.
    * HTML5 and CSS3 must be strong.
    * Experience with varied libraries/frameworks: JQuery, Angular, Ember, Backbone, Bootstrap, Etc.
    * Must be a self-starter and work well within a team environment.
    * Candidates are encouraged to submit a portfolio of their work for review.

At first glance this looks pretty standard but I couldn't help taking
note of a few things you might not catch unless you read it again.

### Not Just the Web Anymore

The word 'web' or 'Internet' isn't even in this post. That's because
web technologies have become the defacto 'front-end' GUI technologies
as well. When people want to put a front end on their monstrous
enterprise application they automatically assume that it will be web
technology. While I personal predict this will change as devices become
more powerful and multi-touch is more usefully deployed, today web tech
is worth a solid investment of your mind-share (as are rapid-deployment,
multi-touch, cross-platform technologies such as Python Kivy).

### Supply Does Not Meet Demand

There are all kinds of surveys and research studies &mdash; most notably
[that](http://www.bls.gov/) from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics
&mdash; showing that the pace of growth in the tech industry is far
exceeding the availability of people who can actually do the work, even
'junior' developers. When he writes, 'junior, mid, and senior developers'
he means, "we are desperate for anyone who can actually code." It also
means that you should not sell yourself short if you actually have
something to show for your skill no matter what your background or
formal education.

### Must Have GitHub 'Portfolio'

"Must submit a portfolio of their work for review," means we really
don't care where you got the skills just that you can prove you have
them. The word 'portfolio' is really, um, lame considering it
originated with an actual paper portfolio containing print outs of
your work. 'Must be able to demonstrate examples of your work' might
have been a better choice but whatever the wording, yeah, you need it.

These days GitHub is the equivalent of a 'portfolio' for developers.
You can create copies of other web sites, show your commits, even show
your social involvement and communication skills. In fact, having a
resume, (which a good LinkedIn profile or blog can cover), is really
secondary to this stuff.

Also, the companies that require printed resumes are quickly becoming
the companies you would never want to work for. These are the same
companies that until only recently wanted you to wear a tie or
khakis to work. That said, most recruiters require you submitting
a resume to them in order to prove that they represent you, blah,
blah, blah. Personally, I'm not into that game and don't see why
anyone else really needs to play that way as well. If you are being
asked to jump through hoops &mdash; and you have a solid 'portfolio'
of skills &mdash; then just don't put up with that crap. Find a job
and environment that you will enjoy working in with people who trust
you to be productive and that you trust back and make stuff happen.

### 'Native' JavaScript is King, Light on jQuery

The first bullet listed is JavaScript even though HTML5 and CSS3 are
listed four lines later with the same 'strong' adjective. In fact,
JavaScript gets another mention as 'Native Javascript' (his caps). I
think this is significant because it shows a deemphasis on jQuery (even
though it is also listed later). What does this mean? It means learn
JavaScript. Seems obvious but worth saying. It used to be you really
just needed to know jQuery and you were good, not anymore. jQuery is
listed because anyone who has been around over the last decade should
at least recognize and be able to deal with jQuery when they have to
support older code.  Most of the reasons jQuery was valuable when the
browsers had no consistent standard have faded, yet there is still a
lot of legacy jQuery code out there to decipher and improve.

### Heavy on the Angular, Backbone and Ember

Angular is the 'A' in [MEAN](http://mean.io/) stack. And while even MEAN will soon be not
so mean due to Koa and ECMAScript 6, (which I think should be called the
[KWAND](http://github.com/kwand) stack), it is clearly here to stay for a long
time. I mean, come on, Google pretty much owns it and they aren't
going anywhere, (which can be said of Python as well).

Backbone and Ember are also cool to play with, but personally I think
it is far more worth your time to invest in truly understanding Angular
and having work to prove it. Enterprises also seem to *love* Angular.

You might not know that Angular comes
with its own little version of jQuery called
[jqLite](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.element)
that you can use for all that jQuery usefulness that remains relevant.

### Self Starting === Drive

Yeah, that's a reference to Daniel Pink's book.

'Self starting' means you love what you do, you wake up thinking about
the next task on your favorite project you will be working on, you
want to learn about the stuff not just to keep up in your career but
because you are viewed as a little crazy by your friends because of
how much you love this stuff.

### Skill Wins Over Experience

This is code for "We don't care how old you are," (which I think would
be illegal to put in a job posting).

The ugly truth is that age is looked on as a liability in the tech world
and especially in the hipster 'front-end' development world. Why? Well
mostly because it is harder to fit into skinny jeans as you age. But other
than that because statistically older developers simply don't keep up on
the current technology. They get established, have families, grow roots,
and lose their edge as they lose time they used to invest in keeping
current. 

The worst part is that with this loss of drive and skill comes
the cognitive-dissonance-powered denial that they are no longer the
rock stars they once were, which slowly bakes them into tech-bigoted,
middle-age curmudgeons who've squashed the laurels they've been sitting
on all this time.

### Wake Up, You Suck

If it sounds like I have personal experience with this you'd be right.
After years of languishing in the big-blue-skill-killing monster that
is IBM spending most of my days in meetings and code reviews rather than
actually creating code I decided to look elsewhere for opportunities to
actually program.

I had watched this sad story play out so many times for other
technologists around me and some I even interviewed, but my turn came
when I could not remember `JSON.parse()` in an interview. Yes I had
used it, but not nearly as much as most front-end AJAX engineers. To my
credit I wrote one sweet-ass JSON parsing routine using Perl regular
expressions that the interviewer had no idea what to do with
except to condescendingly ask, "Do you think there could be a simpler
way to do this?" I wanted to punch his smart ass grin through the phone
mostly because I realized just what a dull-edged clich√© I had become
but instead I laughed it off.

"Hell no!" I thought later to myself inside, or was it very loudly to
my wife hearing me out over a beer, I forget.

"I am NOT that guy."

But I was. It didn't matter how much smarter I was than the
interviewer. It didn't matter how much other amazing stuff I'd done,
(which I'll spare you). All that mattered was that I could do the job
in the most efficient way possible, and in this case apparently that
meant knowing `JSON.parse()`. I couldn't.

While I think interviews like that are largely idiotic because they do
not assess the actual aptitude of an applicant it was enough to get me
back on track. 

### And Then There Was SkilStak

SkilStak started a day or two later at first as an small app to keep
track of where my skills were and where I wanted them to be and later as
a way to help others do the same. Yes I could apply for this or any of
the dozens of other jobs that are out there about which recruiters call
me about once a week, including Google and Amazon. But there is simply
nothing more fun and fulfilling than preparing young technologists early
to face the challenge of a coding career.
