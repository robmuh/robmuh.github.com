***Do not buy iBuyPower under any circumstances no matter how good the
deal.*** At SkilStak Coding Arts parents and students often ask what
computer to buy. My standard recommendation is to *buy a Mac with Windows
on it from a local retailer*. If your budget is tighter and/or you just
want to do web development and 2D basic games&mdash;including GameMaker,
Python games, HTML5 web games, and Minecraft on low-settings, we have
had great success with the $500 Acer 15.6" Aspire Touch Laptop 6GB 750GB
(V5-572P-4824). For higher-end 3D modeling and development stick with the
higher-end Mac with Windows also installed and an i7.

Why? Hardware quality trumps everything else and there is never any
question with Apple computers. There is also never any question about their
customer service, which cannot be over-emphasized.

## Do NOT Buy iBuyPower

Speaking of customer no-service. A simple Google search will confirm why
you should not buy iBuyPower, which is consistent with my experience,
including the very real possibility they are selling you refurbished
hardware as if it were new.

iBuyPower is the worst example of customer service I have ever experienced
in my 25 year career. After shipping 3 out of 5 Revolts ($2000 each)
that would not even run basic Minecraft without crashing out they
continue to fight with me over warranty and support issues. I'm not
exaggerating when I say I have had to send back machines four times,
twice after being returned after sending them the first time and having
them not even boot after they returned them.

They claim the issue is with the shipping and that hardware is moving
around in transit. That doesn't explain the faulty on switch that won't
even power the computer now. And even if it did, it's still no excuse. Can
you imagine Apple customer service saying, well it broke during shipping
so it there is nothing we can do. To add insult to injury iBuyPower after
paying the first RMA now refuses to pay for any of the shipping to fix
the computers they sent me that have not run for more than a month a
time before breaking down.

Students plead and argue with me about iBuyPower because they look
so cool and really target teens, but I'm telling you, your experience
with iBuyPower will likely result in a very expensive computer, that
you perhaps did pay less than from a local retailer for, that simply
doesn't work and no way to get iBuyPower to even talk to you seriously
about fixing it. Buy Best Buy before iBuyPower, but safest of all, invest
the extra money for a Mac with Windows

## Three Computers in One

You pay more of a Mac in general, but if you pay a bit more to have
Windows put on it you get two computers for the price of one. Then if
you add a Linux virtual machine (like our Ubuntu Desktop on a Stick)
you get three.  Mac is the only computer that allows developers to
create software for all three main operating systems and *every* mobile
platform that exists. This is why Macs dominate the developer desktop
and laptop market.
