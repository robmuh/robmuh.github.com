***Do not buy iBuyPower under any circumstances no matter how good
the deal.*** At SkilStak Coding Arts parents and students often ask
what computer to buy. My standard recommendation is to *buy a Mac
with Windows on it from a local retailer*. If your budget is tighter
and/or you just want to do web development and 2D basic
games&mdash;including GameMaker, Python games, HTML5 web games, and
Minecraft on low-settings, we have had great success with the $500
Acer 15.6" Aspire Touch Laptop 6GB 750GB (V5-572P-4824). Normally
Acer would not have been my first recommendation as a brand, but
this exact model has proved very good, better than many Dells I
have purchased in the past. For higher-end 3D modeling and development
stick with the higher-end Mac with Windows also installed and an
i7.

Why? Hardware quality trumps everything else and there is never any
question with Apple computers. There is also never any question about their
customer service, which cannot be over-emphasized.

## Windows on Mac

There are two ways to accomplish this. Both of them are probably best done
by the Apple store if you have any question at all how to do them:

1. Install VMware Fusion and run Windows while booted into your Mac
1. Boot directly into Windows with Bootcamp instead of booting into Mac

The first option is really only for computers that can handle running
two operating systems at the same time. Some will run even more
than that concurrently. It is nice if you want also install Linux
later and you don't intend to do any high-end 3D gaming or modeling.
This option is also good for creating 2D games in the Windows-only
GameMaker Studio for example.  Since you are literally running
Windows in addition to your host operating system (Mac) this is
hard on resources particularly for older Macs. The plus side is you
can simulate an entire network of computers all on one machine if
you have the horsepower.

The second option is preferred if you want to run your Mac exactly
as if it were a Windows machine. This option is particularly good
for those that want to run 3D Windows-only games. It is also best
if you have an older Mac and can't afford sharing resources between
two operating systems.

## Three Computers in One

It seems like you are paying more for a Mac, but if you pay a bit more
to have quality hardware and a machine you can put both Mac OS *and*
Windows on then you are paying for two computers. Then if you add a Linux
virtual machine (like our Ubuntu Desktop on a Stick) you get three.
Mac is the only computer that allows developers to create software
for all three main operating systems and *every* mobile platform that
exists. This is why Macs dominate the developer desktop and laptop market.

## Do NOT Buy iBuyPower

A simple Google search will confirm why you should not buy iBuyPower,
which is consistent with my experience, including the very real
possibility they are selling you refurbished hardware as if it were
new.

iBuyPower is the worst example of customer service I have ever experienced
in my 25 year career. After shipping 3 out of 5 Revolts ($2000 each)
that would not even run basic Minecraft without crashing out they
continue to fight with me over warranty and support issues. I'm not
exaggerating when I say I have had to send back machines four times,
twice after being returned after sending them the first time and having
them not even boot after they returned them.

They claim the issue is with the shipping and that hardware is moving
around in transit. That doesn't explain the faulty on switch that won't
even power the computer now. And even if it did, it's still no excuse. Can
you imagine Apple customer service saying, well it broke during shipping
so it there is nothing we can do. To add insult to injury iBuyPower after
paying the first RMA now refuses to pay for any of the shipping to fix
the computers they sent me that have not run for more than a month a
time before breaking down.

Students plead and argue with me about iBuyPower because they look
so cool and really target teens, but I'm telling you, your experience
with iBuyPower will likely result in a very expensive computer, that
you perhaps did pay less than from a local retailer for, that simply
doesn't work and no way to get iBuyPower to even talk to you seriously
about fixing it. Buy Best Buy before iBuyPower, but safest of all, invest
the extra money for a Mac with Windows
